## Project Description: Have you ever lost someone close? ##
This project captures the process of a character going through a loss of her brother Bilal.

## Process ##
### Phase 1: Sound Collection ###
We used three types of sounds in this project; we downloaded some sound effects from Internet sources, we used AI voice generator, and we recorded the voice of the main character with the audio equipment. As I had previous experience with the Arts booking system, I was in charge of renting the equipment and explaining how to use the equipment to other team members.
